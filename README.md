# MQTT TUI

> Subscribe to a MQTT Topic or publish something quickly from the terminal

Taking a look into existing "lets just view MQTT right now" or "quickly publish something" projects they are always quite bulky and not that fast.

Before having `mqttui` I used [thomasnordquist/MQTT-Explorer](https://github.com/thomasnordquist/MQTT-Explorer) as it has a great overview of what's going on, a small topic based history and a sorted main view.
But having it running its eating up a lot of resources.

Publish something quickly from command line is also not that fun.
The feature rich CLI alternative [hivemq/mqtt-cli](https://github.com/hivemq/mqtt-cli) takes some time to do its job and is not as easy to use as it has a lot of flags to specify.
Subscribing to many topics also isn't as useful to watch at as I hoped for.

That's why I started building my own terminal based version to quickly watch or publish MQTT stuff.
It won't be as feature rich as something like the HiveMQ CLI approach, but it aims at being easy to use and fast.

## Features

### Terminal UI

![Screenshot of the interactive terminal UI](media/tui.png)

```bash
# Subscribe to everything (#)
mqttui

# Subscribe to topic
mqttui "topic"

# Subscribe to topic with a specific host (default is mqtt://localhost)
mqttui --broker "mqtt://test.mosquitto.org" "hello/world"

# More arguments and details
mqttui --help
```

### Publish

```bash
mqttui publish "hello" "world"

mqttui publish --retain "foo/bar" "Banana?"

# More arguments and details
mqttui publish --help
```

### Log to stdout

```plaintext

12:14:06.643 espHome-test/sensor/temperature/state              QoS:AtMostOnce  Payload(  6): 10.568
```

```bash
# Subscribe to topic
mqttui log "topic"

# Multiple topics
mqttui log "topic1" "topic2"

# More arguments and details
mqttui log --help
```

### Clean retained topics

Use the interactive TUI and press Delete or Backspace on a topic to clean the tree or use the subcommand.

![Screenshot of the tui with the cleaning dialog open](media/clean-interactive.png)

```plaintext
$ mqttui publish --retain "hello" "world"

$ mqttui clean-retained "hello"
RETAINED     hello          QoS:AtLeastOnce Payload(  5): world
Cleaned 1 topics
```

```bash
# Clean the topic
mqttui clean-retained "topic"

# Clean the topic tree below
mqttui clean-retained "topic/#"

# More arguments and details
mqttui clean-arguments --help
```

### Configure via environment variables

See the `--help` command for environment variables to be set.

Personally I have set my default broker so I don't have to use `--broker` all the time:

```bash
export MQTTUI_BROKER=mqtt://pi-home.local

# Use the command without specifying the broker every time
mqttui "topic"
```
